 EXERCISE: Optimal Types

  1. Choose the optimal data types for the given situations.
  2. Print them all
  3. Try converting them to lesser data types.
     For example try converting int64 variable to int32.
     Then observe the result.
     Search the web why the result is so?

 NOTE
  This is just an exercise for teaching you different
  data types. Do not apply it to the real-life.

  As I said in the lectures that, premature optimization
  is not a good thing.
